# Xcode-IntelliJ-Dark-Color-Theme
Xcode Color template that emulates the colors and syntax from IntelliJ IDE's

# How it looks?


# How to install?
-  Download the `IntelliJDark.xccolortheme` file
-  Open your terminal and move to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/
-  Execute `open .` to open the actual folder and copy the `IntelliJDark.xccolortheme` file.
-  Open Xcode
-  Go to `Preferences/Colors & Fonts` and choose your new theme.

It can crash on the first time you import this theme, but after reset XCode it should work like a charm ;)
